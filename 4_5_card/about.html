                    I was born in Cambodia in the early 1970s. I became a victim of Cambodian Genocide, which taught me that this
                    world and all of its people are deceased.
                </li>
                <li>
                    At some point later, I joined a Cambodian organized crime syndicate, 
                    where I mastered the use of sai weapons. My crime record was extensive enough to far outrank any ordinary gang pawn.
                </li>   
                <li>
                    I eventually got cyberneticized with a magnetics-based body after being caught in a gang shootout and mortally wounded. 
                    It was at this point that I was offered to work with PMC Desperado, my current occupation.
