                    My body is a unique cyborg chassis consisting of a series of segments held together by E.M. forces which
                    can separate long distances while still remaining part of the whole.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In addition, the E.M. generator is powerful enough to allow me to
                    lift large objects such as Stryker APCs and Hammerhead gunships into the air.

                    My cyborg body itself is highly maneuverable with incredible jumping abilities, 
                    being on par of other powerful cyborgs. My cybernetic feet also has extensions at heels, allowing the heel grip.
